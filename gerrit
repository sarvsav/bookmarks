The project settings are kept in the Git repository for the project. You can edit them by cloning the project from Gerrit, making the change, committing and pushing back to Gerrit.

You can do this for any project, but if you want it to be inherited by all your projects, which you probably do, use All-Projects as the project.

mkdir gtproj
cd gtproj
git init
git remote add origin ssh://<USER>@<GERRITHOST>:29418/<PROJECT>
git fetch origin refs/meta/config:refs/remotes/origin/meta/config
git checkout meta/config
Then, make the change to the project.config file which will now be in the current directory.

Now, commit the change, and push back to the Gerrit repo:

git commit -a -m "Added label - Verified"
git push origin meta/config:meta/config
And that's it.

If you want to test it: assuming you were actually adding the Verified label, you can check it is working like this. First, make sure the refs/heads/* section of All-Projects (or whichever project you changed above) has Label-Verified -1/+1 set for the relevant groups. This allows the listed groups to verify.

Now, assuming you have a project called MyProject and a patchset reference, say 1,1, to verify:

ssh -p 29418 user@host gerrit review --project MyProject --message "'I just verified this patchset'" --verified +1 1,1
This should return more or less immediately. You should now see in the Gerrit web UI that the user you just logged in as over SSH has left a +1 verified review on that patch.
